Create MongoDB Models:
Design MongoDB models for `Appointment`, `Doctor`, and `Patient` in separate files (`Appointment.js`, `Doctor.js`, `Patient.js`).

Set Up Express Routes:
Create separate routes for appointments, doctors, and patients (`appointments.js`, `doctors.js`, `patients.js`).
Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each resource.

Connect to MongoDB:
In your main `server.js`, connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.
Don't forget to handle connection errors.
